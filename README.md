## Challenge Summary
This script could be used again if you had more counties in the election. You would need to modify the script by changing the CSV file with the data from the election, as long as the CSV is in the same format as the one used for this congressional election. You would also need to change the path in which the file should be found in gitbash to ensure the script is run on the correct file. Additionally, you could also use the script again if you had different candidates in the election. The variable to load a file from a path and the varaible to save the file to a path would need to be updated for where the data set is saved for that election.
